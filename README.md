# ElectrostaticRelaxation.jl
A package to solve 1, 2, or 3-dimensional electrostatic relaxation problems. 

The physical problem is to solve for the potential within a volume or (surface, or line) given the potential on the boundary of the volume (or surface or line).

The mathematical problem is to solve for laplace's equation for volume V : 

$$ \nabla^{2}\phi(\textbf{r})=0 $$

Given boundary condition: 

$$ \phi(\textbf{r})=0 $$

# Electrostatics 

Electrostatics is the theory, and study of, the features of **stationary charges** (or groups of charges). The **first** computational problem is to calculate the effect of the stationary charge , or distribution of charge, on a target charge , or distribution of charge i.e. to calculate the force of the source charge (or distribution) on the target charge (or distribution).
