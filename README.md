  ## An Introduction to Laplace's Equation in Context of Electrostatics

  Electrostatics, as the name suggests, is that theory dealing with the properties of a stationary source charge, or bundle of charges, and its effects on a (moving or non-moving) target charge , or bundle of charges. Since basically no charge , or swarm of them, is really ever at rest, electrostatics is an idealization, something thought of to model natural phenomenon in a simple way, but a theory which is not ,maximally realistic. That being said a great deal of natural phenomenon can be modelled via electrostatics. 

  Coloumb: The beginning of electrostatics is Coloumb's law.
